Oslo for 48 hours with one of my best friends, right in the middle of January. A mix between a city break and a ski holiday... you really can not get any better! 

<center><img class="img-responsive" src="img/3.png" width="120" height="120"> </center>


 <p> A city centre hotel is key when wanting to keep the costs down and entertainment levels high, as you wont have to shell out on taxis, we stayed in a cheap and cheerful place called Cochs Pensjonat @ Parkveien 25 0350. This place was grand but wouldn't be the sort of place you would take your partner for a romantic getaway, but for two lads interested in hacking a cheap city break this was ideal! </p>

</p>

<p>I knew feck all about Oslo... it wasn't even on my radar of places to visit, but that quickly changed when we landed, the city is awesome, the people are so nice, food is lovely and its got a ski resort in the capital city! </p>

<p>Traveling on your own is good fun, it forces you to step out of your comfort zone, you meet new people, you are quicker to do stuff and you get to do the things that interest you. But saying all that, sharing an adventure with a friend is 10x better, as you can relive the memory together! My buddy Mark is a history and art nerd, I'm more into adrenalin based activities, we are like Yin and Yang but for whatever reason it works and we never argue about what shit to do, so what I'm trying to say is find a travelling buddy, it makes for a way better adventure and you will do stuff that doesn't necessarily interest you straight off the bat. </p>
                   

<p> We had three manin objectives. 1) Edvard Munch's The Scream and Madonna, 2) Vigelandsparken Sculpture Park, and 3) Night Toboggan.</p>

<center><img class="img-responsive" src="img/scream.jpg" alt=""> </center>


<p> <h4>Edvard Munch (National Museum) </h4> World famous painting, only four variations in the world, two of which are in the Olso National Museum... the forth one sold for $119 million  </p>
  
  <center><img class="img-responsive" src="img/SCOSLOS.jpg" alt=""> </center>

<p><h4>Vigelandsparken Sculpture Park</h4> 
Its beautiful and worth a visit, we grabbed a coffee an walked around the park looking at the pieces, so interesting 212 bronze and granite creations from Norwegian sculptor Gustav Vigeland, and a cheap alternative the rather expensive city.</p>

<center><img class="img-responsive" src="img/nt.jpg" alt=""> </center>

<p><h4>Night Toboggan</h4> 
Fuck me sideways this was good fun! Weirdest part, you grab the subway and 15 stops later you are at the top of a snow capped mountain in the Nordmarka forest complete with miles upon miles of cross-country ski trails, and of course tobogganing! Dirt cheap €20 includes your boots, gloves, helmet and toboggan. You can keep going until late, as they’re lit up past 10pm.</p>

<p><h4>Cafe</h4> 
Cool coffee shops to beat the band. Check out the Grünerløkka district to the east of the centre very trendy, loads of cool coffee shops and casual eateries. If you're looking to get a bit of work done, you can crack open your laptop in a place called Grünerløkka lufthavn, which is run by a creative cooperative and housed in an old school building. Coffee shop in the back, nice music and the odd event.

</p>
<p><h4>Dinner</h4> 
You gotta hit Mathallen (literally ‘food hall’) huge indoor food market in the Grünerløkka area, 30+ stalls, bars and restaurants. Great atmosphere, relatively affordable (Oslo is an expensive mother fucker). Oslo is going through a little Mexican food obsession, so finding a nice burrito bar is easy, loads dotted around the city. Pickled herring – pretty much Norway’s national dish try it!
</p>

<p>
   Also check out Lokk - very cool spot specialising in soups and stews, ideal for after an evening of skiing! </p>

<center><img class="img-responsive" src="img/oslofood.jpg" alt=""> </center>
<span class="caption text-muted">Mathallen defiantly worth a visit.</span>

<p><h4>Night life</h4> 
<p>Norwegians love a bit of foreplay - or how they say it forspill, this is drinking before you head out, so don't be surprised when bars and clubs are empty, people drink at home and hit the clubs around 11p.m, this is done to save a shit ton of money!

Hit Baroque which is pretty cool, chill with the city’s best cocktails at Sense, or dance to live music at Skaugum where there’s a house party vibe, this was our best night spot. There’s no shortage of more laid-back café-bars just look around, I have generally found that there always seems to be decent places to party near a McDonalds...pissed people love a BigMac!</p>

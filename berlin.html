I have been looking forward to visiting Berlin for the longest time, a city with incredible history and culture bursting at the seams. There is so much to do and see in Berlin which makes it the perfect place to escape for the weekend.</p>

 <p>This is strange... but for some reason when visiting Berlin I get the most overwhelming feeling to stay in a really weird artsy hotel, it just feels like the right thing to do... so this trip i skipped out on the Radisson and went for something a little different. <p> Amazing thing about Berlin is that there is no shortage of weird and wonderful places to stay, accommodation in general is also very reasonable. Myself and my girlfriend stayed in the weird and wonderful <a href="www.huettenpalast.de/?lang=en">Huettenpalast</a>, which is located in Hobrechtstraße, which is a really great area for small bars, coffee shops and amazing restaurants. Great thing about this hotel is that its a giant warehouse that has ben filled with funky caravans as rooms. There are communal bathrooms and showers these are seriously good so no need to worry about hygiene or privacy. If you do not like the idea of your hotel resembling a giant indoor campsite then check out  <a href="http://www.hotello.de/k80-berlin/">H'Otello K'80</a>, this place is really cool and located in the middle of West Berlin. Last but not least you cant go wrong with the <a href="https://generatorhostels.com/en/destinations/berlin/prenzlauer-berg/">Generator Hostel</a>, Day or night, there’s always something happening in Prenzlauer Berg. Hang out in Bohemian cafés and bars, stumble across live music and street art, or just soak up the good vibes in East Berlin’s most laid-back neighbourhood. Generator Prenzlauer Berg sits in the heart of the action, near tram stops and Landsberger Allee S-Bahn station.  </p>

<p>New York an amazing place that has always held a special place in my heart, but now as I get older and I have friends that live there, it means so much more to me, I get to go explore, live like a lokal and do all this with my best friends.</p>
                   

<p>The three main objectives for this weekend; 1) Brandenburg Gate, 2) East Side Gallery (Berlin Wall), and 3) Chill in Kreuzberg.</p>

<center><img class="img-responsive" src="img/lokal-broklyn.jpg" alt=""> </center>


<p> <h4>Brandenburg Gate</h4> 
    <p>Every Saturday on the Williamsburg waterfront at East River State Park, amazing food, from asian to bbq, and best of all unreal donuts. Host to purveyors from New York City and across the region total of 100 odd vendors. Defiantly worth a visit, and nothing better then chilling on the waterfront looking at the Manhattan skyline while smashing donuts. </p>
  
<center><img class="img-responsive" src="img/lokal-spin.jpg" alt=""> </center>

<p><h4>East Side Gallery (Berlin Wall)</h4> 
<p>Table tennis is a big thing in my office so getting my skills up while in a nightclub setting was obviously going to happen. This place is awesome we rented a table, stayed here till 2am with loads of beers, ping pong and friends. What more could you ask for! $49 for the hour.</p>

<center><img class="img-responsive" src="img/lokal-pranna.jpg" alt=""> </center>

<p><h4>Kreuzberg</h4> 
<p>This is an experience like no other, the food is decent, the surroundings are crazy! Christmas tree lights shine year-round, you share tables, lights flash on and off, the music of course is 80s hits and best of all its BYOB. Ring and book, but you will still end up waiting in a queue outside for an hour...just accept this as nothing about this place is normal, don't be tricked into the neighbouring restaurants which are trying to copy what Panna II has created, as you will be disappointed. </p>


<p><h4>Cafe/lunch </h4> 
<p> Like Dublin, London and Amsterdam, New York is all about Brunch and trendy lunch spots, no better place to nurse a hangover than <a href="http://www.juliettewilliamsburg.com">Juliette</a> in Williamsburg, really nice food and a great atmosphere. Generally no booking required. <p> Another great spot for brunch is <a href="http://www.friendofafarmer.com/">Friend of a Farmer</a> located in Manhattan at Gramercy Park, this place was epic but requires a booking, if you sit at the bar you can skip the queue, I literally fell into this place after crashing in a sweet apartment over looking the Empire State Building, order the corn bread as a side it's lovely.   
</p>

<p>
<p><h4>Tip</h4> 
<p>Be smart and get around on the <a href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/pricing#casual">NYC Citi Bikes</a>. You can rent bikes for $25 for seven days. Also get yourself a <a href="http://web.mta.info/metrocard/mvms/index.htm">MetroCard</a> so you can jump on the Subway and busses, lash $15 on your MetroCard and you'll be golden.  </p>

</p>


<p><h4>Dinner</h4> 
<p>When lookng for a place to eat in Berlin you have to check out <a href="https://www.shakeshack.com/location/madison-square-park/">Berlin Food Stories</a>, it's an amazing food blog covering the very best places to eat. This was our food bible and it didnt dissapoint!

<p>First up we hit <a href="peterluger.com">Zola</a> located in Kreuzberg. For one of the coolest laid back stone baked pizzas I have ever had! We gorged on three pizzas, 4 beers and a bottle of red wine and only cost €48. Thsi place is really nice and tottally worth a visit.

<p>Our second night we where craving asian food, so had to visit <a href="http://www.burgerandlobster.com/home/">Cocolo Ramen</a> located @ Paul-Lincke-Ufer 39-40, 10999. This place is the defenifion a 'Dine and Dash'. We ordered all the starters, had pork and chicken ramen and a few beers to wash it all down.

<p><h4>Night</h4> 
<p>Partying in New York is easy, there are so many options, and a place to suit every taste. Want  cocktails late at night and want to feel like your in Paris in the 1800s hit  <a href="http://www.dearirving.com/"> Dear Irving</a>. Want a casual place with normal priced beers, live music on the street level & a saloon with a roof deck above it, then hit <a href="www.therockshopny.com/">The Rock Shop</a>. My favourite place this trip was <a href="http://www.petestavern.com/#!/-1/">Pete’s Tavern</a> this place is a real old mans pub, I loved it because it wasn't trying to be cool, it wasn't filled with intagram fame whores, it was a place where I got to drink the night away with my best friend and catch up and recount old memories.</p>

This is an odd one, Christmas in Bangkok is not something you hear too many people say, but for me exploring a new place, embracing the culture and stepping outside of the normal (a family Christmas dinner at home) is all part of living life a tiny bit differently to the crowd, and right outside of 'normal' is where I feel most comfortable! </p>

 <p>Bangkok has a bad rep as being a city crowded city, a place you generally have to put up with to get to one of the tropical islands for a beach holiday. I view Bangkok differently... I see it as an amazing city bursting with personality, a place where traditional markets and temples sit side by side with skyscrapers, rooftop bars and mega malls. <p> Bangkok can be what ever you want it to be, you can live like a king in high end hotels or chill in a hostel catering for the passing backpackers. When staying in Bangkok I opt for <a href="http://hotelmusebangkok.com/">The Muse Hotel</a>, which is located in Langsuan, which is right between all of Bangkok’s key locations, including Siam, Sukhumvit and Silom, really cool hotel, voted as having the 7th best rooftop bar in Bangkok! Rooms start at €130 a night.<p> If you want to stay down by the river, then you have to hit the <a href="http://www.mandarinoriental.com/">Mandarin Oriental</a>, this place is really nice, dinner down by the river, watching the Thai longtail boats navigate the waterway makes for a beautiful setting. Finally if cheap and chearful is what you want, but not a place you will get murdered in then check out <a href="http://onedaybkk.com/home.html">One Day Hostel</a>, located in Sukhumvit soi which is the dream location, rooms start at €10 a night. </p>

<p>Loads to do in Bangkok, I wanted to approach this trip differently. I usually run around like crazy, but this time I was more relaxed and took in my surroundings. Bangkok can be a culture shock and I am sure it's one of the reasons some people get turned off when they arrive here and look forward to hitting the island beaches. </p>
                   

<p> I had three main objectives. 1) Tuk Tuk around the city, 2) Wat Pho Temple, and 3) Khao San Road.</p>

<center><img class="img-responsive" src="img/bk3.jpg" alt=""> </center>


<p> <h4>Tuk Tuk around the city</h4> 
    <p>Using Tuk Tuks to get around Bangkok is not only great fun, but its really cheap! Just make sure you don't get fucked around and brought to a shit suit tailor! We asked a tuk tuk driver to bring us to the 4 main temples around Bangkok, the Royal Palace, flower market and China Town and it cost us 250 bhat! Some travel companies offer tours, which are good but this is defiantly one you can organise and manage yourself.</p>
  
<center><img class="img-responsive" src="img/bk4.jpg" alt=""> </center>

<p><h4>Wat Pho Temple</h4> 
<p> Buddhist temple complex in Phra Nakhon district. It is located on Rattanakosin Island directly to the south of the Grand Palace. Stunningly beautiful, free to enter. Just make sure you have shorts that cover your knees and a t-shirt to cover your shoulders. Rather then going in and snapping like crazy with the camera just chill and watch the locals worship. </p>

<center><img class="img-responsive" src="img/bk5.jpg" alt=""> </center>

<p><h4>Khao San Road</h4> 
<p>Backpackers paradise - has transformed into a tourist trap locals sell insects on sticks, fake shit and ping pong shows. Worth a visit and defiantly an experience! </p>


<p><h4>Cafe/lunch </h4> 
<p> Even the hipster revolution has invade Thailand, for a lovely Breakfast (8-10am) hit <a href="www.facebook.com/blackboxbangkok#sthash.uwwjz9Xd.dpuf">Black Box</a> located at Mahatun Plaza, 888/8-9 Phloen Chit Rd. really nice food and a great atmosphere. No booking required. <p> Another great spot for brunch is <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.ie/Restaurant_Review-g293916-d2393714-Reviews-Gastro_1_6-Bangkok.html">Gastro</a> located in RMA Studio, Soi Sainamthip 2, Sukhumvit Soi 22. <P> I got pretty lucky and dinned one day at a pop-up McDonalds where you could create your own burger, made a nice change from street food :)  
</p>


<center><img class="img-responsive" src="img/bk6.jpg" alt=""> </center>
<span class="caption text-muted"> Create Your Own Burger - Pop Up @ Pathum Wan district </span>
<p>
<p><h4>Tip</h4> 
<p>When getting a taxi, tuk tuk or motorbike taxi if you are not staying in a very well known hotel like the Hilton or Marriott carry a hotel card with directions as your Thai is shit and trying to pronounce the street names will ultimately result in failure.</p>
    
<center><img class="img-responsive" src="img/1.png" width="120" height="120"> </center>
</p>


<p><h4>Dinner</h4> 
<p>No real surprise, Thai food featured very heavily... very different to my staple diet of burgers. Thai street food is amazing, the roads are lined with food vendors, everything from dried fruit, meat skewers and juice bars. You can eat full meals for as little as €3 which can come as a relief to cash straped backpackers, but should you however be in a slightly more affluent position then you should hit <a href="http://eatmerestaurant.com/">Eat Me</a> located just 20 metres off Convent Rd in Soi Pipat 2
Silom, the food is beautiful which fuses influences from around the world, with the owner being from Australia and NYC.
<p>
<a href="http://www.issaya.com/issaya-index.php">Issaya Siamese Club</a> is an absolute gem of a restaurant serving outstanding food, in a traditional setting, seriously worth a visit, and requires a reservation for sure! 

<p>One thing is for sure when it comes to Bangkok dinning, and that is the options available are outstanding. Bangkok was a complete surprise to me, a bustling city bursting with culture and then to top it off a foodie paradise!

<p><h4>Night</h4> 
<p>Hitting the Koh San road for a night out is amazing you will meet travellers from all over the world, but if you are in the mood for partying with the affluent Thai's then you will be drinking in one of the many rooftop bars! First on the list and the most touristy due to it being featured in The Hangover movie is the<a href="http://www.lebua.com/sirocco/"> Sky Bar</a>. Next up and 61 floors above the bustling streets, is the stylish setting that fuses fairytale romance and cosmopolitan chic; <a href="http://www.banyantree.com/en/ap-thailand-bangkok/vertigo-and-moon-bar">Vertigo and Moon Bar</a>. My favourite place this trip was <a href="http://www.petestavern.com/#!/-1/">The Speakeasy</a> located in Hotel Muse takes you back to the 1920’s Prohibition era. Great music, closes early (midnight) cocktails are good value and the views are pretty beautiful.</p>

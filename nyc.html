Shit the bed I am so excited to be spending 5 days in New York! What makes it 100 times better is I am visiting my best friend who now lives in Brooklyn, so I will be crashing with him and doing as lokals do!</p> 

<center><img class="img-responsive" src="img/3.png" width="120" height="120"> </center>


 <p>When 99% of people visit NYC they stay in Manhattan, shop in Manhattan, eat in Manhattan, take a shit in Manhattan and completely neglect the amazingness that is the other four burrows. I had the fortune of crashing in an amazing apartment right in the heart of Williamsburg, Brooklyn (Hipster Heaven). <p> Great thing about NYC is that there are a shit ton of hotels for every budget, also airBnBs to beat the band. If staying in Manhattan check out <a href="http://www.thegemhotel.com/">The Gem Hotel</a>, which is located in Chelsea, really cool hotel, and if you book in advance, rooms start at $200 a night. Want to stay in Brooklyn then you have to hit the <a href="http://www.theboxhousehotel.com/">The Box House Hotel</a>, this place is really fucking cool, all the rooms are lofts and start at $150 a night. Finally check out <a href="http://www.condorny.com/">Condor Hotel</a>, another Brooklyn hotel located in Williamsburg which is the dream location, rooms start at $250 a night. Also if you are worried about being away from Manhattan, don't be it's 12min on the Subway.   </p>

<p>New York an amazing place that has always held a special place in my heart, but now as I get older and I have friends that live there, it means so much more to me, I get to go explore, live like a lokal and do all this with my best friends.</p>
                   

<p> I had three main objectives (other then chilling with friends). 1) Williamsburg Smorgasburg Market, 2) Hit Spin NYC for a night out, and 3) Dinner @ Pranna II .</p>

<center><img class="img-responsive" src="img/lokal-broklyn.jpg" alt=""> </center>


<p> <h4>Williamsburg Smorgasburg Market</h4> 
    <p>Every Saturday on the Williamsburg waterfront at East River State Park, amazing food, from asian to bbq, and best of all unreal donuts. Host to purveyors from New York City and across the region total of 100 odd vendors. Defiantly worth a visit, and nothing better then chilling on the waterfront looking at the Manhattan skyline while smashing donuts. </p>
  
<center><img class="img-responsive" src="img/lokal-spin.jpg" alt=""> </center>

<p><h4>Spin NYC</h4> 
<p>Table tennis is a big thing in my office so getting my skills up while in a nightclub setting was obviously going to happen. This place is awesome we rented a table, stayed here till 2am with loads of beers, ping pong and friends. What more could you ask for! $49 for the hour.</p>

<center><img class="img-responsive" src="img/lokal-pranna.jpg" alt=""> </center>

<p><h4>Panna II</h4> 
<p>This is an experience like no other, the food is decent, the surroundings are crazy! Christmas tree lights shine year-round, you share tables, lights flash on and off, the music of course is 80s hits and best of all its BYOB. Ring and book, but you will still end up waiting in a queue outside for an hour...just accept this as nothing about this place is normal, don't be tricked into the neighbouring restaurants which are trying to copy what Panna II has created, as you will be disappointed. </p>


<p><h4>Cafe/lunch </h4> 
<p> Like Dublin, London and Amsterdam, New York is all about Brunch and trendy lunch spots, no better place to nurse a hangover than <a href="http://www.juliettewilliamsburg.com">Juliette</a> in Williamsburg, really nice food and a great atmosphere. Generally no booking required. <p> Another great spot for brunch is <a href="http://www.friendofafarmer.com/">Friend of a Farmer</a> located in Manhattan at Gramercy Park, this place was epic but requires a booking, if you sit at the bar you can skip the queue, I literally fell into this place after crashing in a sweet apartment over looking the Empire State Building, order the corn bread as a side it's lovely.   
</p>


<center><img class="img-responsive" src="img/juliettebkny-lokal.jpg" alt=""> </center>
<span class="caption text-muted"> Juliette @ 135 N 5th St, Brooklyn, NY 11249</span>
<p>
<p><h4>Tip</h4> 
<p>Be smart and get around on the <a href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/pricing#casual">NYC Citi Bikes</a>. You can rent bikes for $25 for seven days. Also get yourself a <a href="http://web.mta.info/metrocard/mvms/index.htm">MetroCard</a> so you can jump on the Subway and busses, lash $15 on your MetroCard and you'll be golden.  </p>
    
<center><img class="img-responsive" src="img/1.png" width="120" height="120"> </center>
</p>


<p><h4>Dinner</h4> 
<p>No real surprise, but burgers featured heavily on my diet this trip, first on the list; park burgers at <a href="https://www.shakeshack.com/location/madison-square-park/">Shake Shack</a> located at Madison Square Park, which is an amazing burger, and don't be put off by the queue as it moves really quick.
<p>
New York and steaks go hand in hand, and the choice of steak joints in NYC is mesmerising, for a super famous and old school steak house, which you 100% will need to book hit <a href="peterluger.com">Peter Luger Steak House</a> located in Brooklyn. For one of the coolest laid back steak houses I have ever been too, you got to hit <a href="https://instagram.com/stanselmrestaurant/"> St. Anselm</a> this place is amazing, and the food is fucking unreal, you'll need to book and also there is no A/C so this place gets really fucking hot! 

<p>Want somewhere for the family, take 'em to <a href="http://www.burgerandlobster.com/home/">Burger and Lobster</a>, we hit this place randomly and the food was nice, go for the Lobster roll over the burger located @ 39 West 19th Street Flatiron :)  
</p>

<p><h4>Night</h4> 
<p>Partying in New York is easy, there are so many options, and a place to suit every taste. Want  cocktails late at night and want to feel like your in Paris in the 1800s hit  <a href="http://www.dearirving.com/"> Dear Irving</a>. Want a casual place with normal priced beers, live music on the street level & a saloon with a roof deck above it, then hit <a href="www.therockshopny.com/">The Rock Shop</a>. My favourite place this trip was <a href="http://www.petestavern.com/#!/-1/">Pete’s Tavern</a> this place is a real old mans pub, I loved it because it wasn't trying to be cool, it wasn't filled with intagram fame whores, it was a place where I got to drink the night away with my best friend and catch up and recount old memories.</p>

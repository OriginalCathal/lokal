How the hell did I find myself in Kuala Lumpur for 24hours! Don't worry I ain't complaining this place is the dream! </p>

 <p>After doing a little island hopping around Thailand, I can think of no better way to ease myself back into city life then a short trip to KL befor I bounce back home!<p> KL has a huge amount of hotels, so you really are spoiled for choice, but even better then the amount of cool places to stay are the prices, for a capital city KL has to have some of the most affordable room rates.  When looking for a hotel in KL you have to stay in the Bukit Bintang area as its the hub for restaurants, bars, nightclubs and shopping. I stayed in <a href="http://www.kljournalhotel.com/">The Journal</a>, which is located right in the centre of Bukit Bintang, really cool hotel, and if you book in advance, rooms start at $60 a night. I don't usual harp on about hotel but this place was amazing, really modern, massive rooms, excellent showers and posturepedic beds which are the dream!!</p>

<p>KL is a like no other place I have ever visited, the mix of cultures makes for a really special place. Anyone you talk too about KL all love it. Its really hard to pin point exactly what makes this place so cool, at a stab the people are friendly the western and asian cultures mix really well in this modern capital city. There is a huge amount of younger people livng and working in the city which is fueling the modern and vibrant atmosphere. On every street virtually there are creativ spaces for co-working. </p>
                   

<p> As usual I had three main objectives. 1) Petronas Twin Towers, 2) Petaling Street China Town, and 3) Chill in KLCC Park . <P>(Fairly touristy activities but with fuck all time in KL didn't have time to chill in local hangouts)</p>

<center><img class="img-responsive" src="img/kl3.jpg" alt=""> </center>


<p> <h4>Petronas Twin Towers</h4> 
    <p>They used to be the worlds tallest towers, but more than that, they are in my opinion architecturally beautiful. I decided not to accent the towers as the best perspective to admire is from KLCC park. The base of the towers is a high end shopping mall with worth a vist.  </p>
  
<center><img class="img-responsive" src="img/kl4.jpg" alt=""> </center>

<p><h4>Petaling Street China Town</h4> 
<p>Typical China Town, if you want to buy fake/counterfeit goods this is the place to go, and don't be afraid to ask to see the "showroom" this is where they store the really good quality bags and clothes, other than that it's a pretty interesting part of town, certainly older and more traditional.</p>

<center><img class="img-responsive" src="img/kl5.jpg" alt=""> </center>

<p><h4>KLCC Park</h4> 
<p>Perfect place to grab a coffee and escape the crazy busy city, especially after China town madness, we simply walked the jogging track admired the sculptures and chilled out before we had to catch our flight out of KL.</p>


<p><h4>Cafe/lunch </h4> 
<p> Imbi market is home to some of Malaysia's best and most celebrated breakfasts and coffee. The most iconic stall is Ah Wenf Koh. Also hit up Hainanese Institution for breakfast eggs in and on toast can't be beat! <p> A great spot for lunch is Jai Hind located at 13 Jalan Melyu - little bit sweaty but worth it. <p> Loads of U.S coffee chains in KL... they seam to love western brands, but if you are looking for a nice authentic coffee and a place to work/chill for a few hours check out Thirdwave.

<p><h4>Tip</h4> 
<p>Negotiate the price of taxis before you start your journey. Also get yourself a <a href="http://www.myrapid.com.my/rail%3Fcode%3DMRL">MyRapid</a> card so you can jump on the Monorail, costs feck all and worth it as taxis arn't easiest to get during rush hour.  </p>

<p><h4>Dinner</h4> 
<p>Unfortunatly I was so rushed in KL I didn't have much opportunity to hit up a few different dinner spots, but I have been told on good authority that these three places are the ones to fill your belly! <a href="http://www.marble-8.com/steak-house-menu/">Marble 8 </a> a steakhouse hailed as a haven for steak-lovers located 10-minute walk from the KLCC LRT station. 
<p>
Hit up <a href="http://thebiggroup.co/bakar/"> Bakar</a> for a grilling masterclass, check out the grilled watermellon starter which comes in a salad with strawberry, pomegranate, chilli, radish, cucumber and coriander, located @ 11B Lorong Kurau 
Taman Weng Lock.

<p>Hit <a href="http://mercat.my/">Mercat</a>, a really cool gastropub serving European dishes. This place is known for its Iberico pork ribs. Located @ 51 Jalan Telawi 3 :)  
</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">Mercat @ 51 Jalan Telawi 3</span>


<p><h4>Night</h4> 
<p>Partying in KL is all about the rooftop bars... in fact partying in most Asian cities is all about hitting a rooftop bar, which in my opinion is amazing! <a href="http://www.aloftkualalumpursentral.com/en/maibar"> Mai Bar</a>, is not a bad spot for a drink, located on the 30th floor of the Aloft Kuala Lumpur Sentral. The bar features a rooftop poolside bar. <p>Check out <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OmakaseAppreciate/">Omakase + Appreciate</a> nice speakeasy joint with extensive cocktails.  </p>
